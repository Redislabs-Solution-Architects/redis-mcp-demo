# Redis MCP Demos

With Model Context Protocol (MCP), you can manage Redis through conversation instead of learning commands and writing integration code.
We've built two demos to show you what's possible when Redis gets an AI interface.

## Two Demo Scenarios

### **Chatbot Persistent Memory** → `conversation-context/`  
[→ Setup & Run Instructions](conversation-context/README.md)

This demo compares traditional Redis integration with Redis MCP for LLM applications with persistent memory. It provides working examples of both approaches. The demo showcases MCP's reduction in code complexity and persistence across multiple chat sessions. 

**Purpose:** Demonstrate Redis MCP's impact on application development complexity  
**Audience:** Developers building AI applications, teams evaluating Redis integration approaches  

### **Infrastructure and Data Prototyping** → `claude-desktop/`
[→ Setup & Run Instructions](claude-desktop/README.md)

Manage Redis Cloud databases through Claude Desktop chat. Create databases, seed data, and get AI optimization suggestions without learning Redis commands.

**Purpose:** Show Redis MCP's capability for database management and architecture discovery  
**Audience:** Solutions architects, developers exploring Redis, teams doing rapid prototyping
